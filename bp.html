<h1>SDL Boilerplate Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
In this activity,
you will select a task that needs to get done for the
SDL Boilerplate project and start to work on that.
</p>

<h2>References</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="">SDL Boilerplate Project</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Set Up</h2>

<p>
In addition to maintaining your course repository,
you will also maintain a repository on Github.
This Github repository will be a fork of the SDL Boilerplate repository.
You will then be able to push your work on the Boilerplate
to Github so that the Boilerplate maintainers can merge your additions.
</p>

<p>
If you don't already have a Github account,
create one now.  The free tier service is sufficient for this course.
</p>

<p>
After logging into Github,
fork the SDL Boilerplate repository.
Then clone your forked repository into your local development environment.
Make sure that you can build and run the code.
</p>

<h2>Start a Task</h2>

<p>
Write up a short proposal on how you want to contribute to the Boilerplate project.
Email this to me for feedback and final approval.
See <a href="todo.html">the course TODO list</a> for ideas
on how to contribute to the project.
</p>

<p>
Add a file named <em>BP.md</em> to your course repository.
In this file, place a link to your Github repository
and include the text to you approved boilerplate task proposal.
That way, I have a record of how to get to your files
and a description of what you are working on.
</p>

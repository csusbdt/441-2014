<h2>OpenGL Notes</h2>

<p>
Only one vertex buffer can be active at a time.
</p>

<p>
Only one shader program can be active at a time.
</p>

<h2>Graphics Pipeline</h2>

<p>
Graphics systems produce animations by rendering a series of frames.
The pixel information that goes to the screen comes from a block of memory
referred to as the frame buffer.
They use a double buffering approach to ensure that partially updated frame buffers are not rendered.
Without double buffering, unpleasant visual artifacts would appear.
The hardware refreshes the display from a front buffer while applications
write into a back buffer.
After writing to the back buffer completes,
the system swaps the front and back buffers.
</p>

<p>
When your render function is called,
you can affect the state of the back frame buffer before it is swapped with the front buffer.
This swapping will happen after you return from your render function
but before your render function is called again.
</p>

<p>
The OpenGL draw functions that you call in your code
result in a sequence of operations that occur within 
what is referred to as the <em>graphics pipeline<em>
or the <em>rendering pipeline</em>.
The following is my understanding of the process (minus the geometry shader step),
which may be issing something.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple instances of the active vertex shader execute in parallel for the vertex data that you specified.</li>
<li>The vertex shader outputs a coordinate in clip space and possibly other varying data, such as UV coordinates.</li>
<li>Point, line and triangle primatives are assembled with vertices in clip space coordinates.</li>
<li>Primitives that completely lie outside of the box with corners (-1, -1, -1) and (1, 1, 1) are discarded.</li>
<li>The remaining primitives are rasterized into fragments and their corresponding varying variables are computed.</li>
<li>Multiple instances of the active fragment shader execute in parallel for the resulting fragments.</li>
<li>The fragment shader either discards the fragment or outputs an RGBA color value.</li>
<li>If enabled, fragments with the same position are blended.</li>
</ul>

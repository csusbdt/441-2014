<h1>IDE</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
In this class you should be able to work in either Visual Studio or Xcode
(or an IDE for Linux if you are running Linux).
I will demonstrate both of these IDEs in this course.
</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>
If you are working in JB 360, Visual Studio 2010 is already installed,
so you don't need to install anything.
</p>

<p>
There is a free version of Visual Studio that you can use for this course called 
Visual C++ 2010 Express.
</p>

<p>
Xcode is a free download on the App Store.

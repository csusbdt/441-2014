<h1>Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
For the remainder of the course, we will be building point-and-click adventure games.
For this purpose, you need to decide between being an engine developer or a scripter.
If you choose to be an engine developer, then you will develop C/C++ code that 
provides functionality to the scripters.
If you choose to be a scripter, then you will need to work with one or
more game engine developers to write the scripts that
implement the specific game.
</p>

<p>
Engine developers will need to write scripts as well --
they need to develop example scripts that show how the scripters 
interact with the C/C++ functionality provided by the engine.
The scripters will be responsibile for the game design and
gathering the neccessary art assets and dialog.
The art assets can be stubs and
the dialog and game play can be very simple.
</p>

<p>
The games should run on at least one mobile device.
</p>

<p>
I will provide example code as the course progresses,
but you can not use me as an engine developer.
If you are an engine developer, you need to add additional
functionality beyond what I provide
or implement it using a different approach.
I will store example code developed during lecture
in <a href="https://github.com/csusbdt/441-2014">this repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
Students can be in more than one team.
</p>

<h2>Project Formation</h2>

<p>
Talk to other members of the class and form aliances.
Decide what you will do and how to get started.
You can work alone if that's your preference.
</p>

<p>
For each project, I need the following three things.
</p>

<ul>
<li>A joint venture agreement (for team projects only).</li>
<li>A requirements specification.</li>
<li>The URL of a remote git repository that I can access.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Joint venture agreement</h3>

<p>
The joint venture agreement for each project
should include the following items.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The project name.</li>
<li>The members of the team and a descirption of their responsibilities.</li>
<li>A designation of who is the engine developer.</li>
<li>A statement of whether the project is open source or closed source.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements specification</h3>

<p>
The requirements specification for each project states what the team (or individual) will be building.
The document should include the following.
</p>

<ul>
<li>A high-level descirption of the game.</li>
<li>A description of the application screens. (Application screens could be 
    title screen, main menu screen, credits screen, help screen, game play screen,
    inventory screen, etc.)</li>
<li>A list of target platforms that the game will run on.
     This list must include either Android or iOS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remote Git repository</h3>

<p>
If you want to do an open source project, then use the free version of GitHub.
If you want to do a closed source project, then use the paid version of GitHub or
ask me to setup a private repository for you on school servers.
In any case, I should be able to clone your repository and build your project
under either OS X or Windows.
</p>

<p>
The initial repository should include as a starting point
a simple hello program that builds
and runs on the computers that the team members will be using.

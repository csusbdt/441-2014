<h2>SDL Boilerplate</h2>

<p>
One goal for this class is to create a boilerplate project
to function as a starting point for 2D game projects that
build to Windows, OS X, iOS and Android.
The boilerplate will have the following characteristics.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses SDL2, SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf. (done)</li>
<li>Written in C/C++ and Lua. (done)</li>
<li>Generates application installers for OS X, Windows, iOS and Android.</li>
<li>Illustrates sprite-based animation using SDL2 textures.</li>
<li>Illustrates mouse click and touch event handling.</li>
<li>Builds in Xcode and Visual Studio 2010 Express.</li>
<li>Provides a built-in console overlay that can be toggled on and off, to allow input of Lua chunks.</li>
<li>Includes setup instructions for OS X, Windows and Linux,
    including instructions on how the library binaries are built.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extended Boilerplate</h2>

<p>
The following features can be added to the base boilerplate.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Generates installer for Linux.</li>
<li>Replace Visual Studio support with Code Blocks or other IDE.</li>
<li>Illustrates side scroller character movement.</li>
<li>Illustrates the use of Box2D.</li>
<li>Provides a very simple GUI library (label, button, text input).</li>
<li>Illustrates screen transitions.</li>
<li>Provides a compressed atlas for assets (image data, Lua scripts).</li>
<li>Illustrates playback of sound effects (memory resident).</li>
<li>Illustrates playback of music (stream from file).</li>
<li>Add multiplayer support. (Mark Swoope)</li>

</ul>

<h2>OS X Application Bundle</h2>

<p>
Develop a process that builds the game to an application bundle that 
can be dragged into the Applications folder for installation without requiring 
the end user to have SDL installed.
See README-macosx.txt in the source distribution of SDL.

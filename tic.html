<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Implement the game of Tic Tac Toe using SDL and Lua.
Have the user play against the computer.
Let the user go first but make sure the computer never loses.
</p>

<p>
The C-side of the program should provide a basic line drawing command.
The Lua-side of the program should use this line draw function
to draw the grid and the X's and O's.
Draw X's with 2 line draw commands and draw O's as boxes with 4 line draw commands.
</p>

<p>
Define Lua modules for the purpose of drawing X's and O's.
For example, define the X module in file X.lua.
This module should contain a single function that creates drawable X's.
Code that uses the X module should look something like the following.
</p>

<pre>
local X = require('app.X')

...

local x1 = X.create(30, 100) -- create an X at pixel position (30, 100)

...

function on_draw()
    x1:draw()
end
</pre>

<p>
Look at the
<a href="https://github.com/csusbdt/441-2014">the example code presented in class</a> 
as a foundation for your entire solution to the problem.
Look at the Button module in particular
to get an idea about how to design the X and O modules.
</p>

<h2>Project Organization</h2>

<p>
Create a folder <em>~/441/tic</em> in your repository 
to hold your solution for this assignment.
Organize the contents of the tic folder as follows.
</p>

<pre>
src/      -- C/C++ source code
app/      -- Lua modules
main.lua  -- Lua module called during initialization
</pre>

<p>
You don't need to include any build files in your repository,
such as makefiles, Visual Studio project files or Xcode project files.
However, you can include these if you want to.
</p>

<p>
Note that the program does not need to load any images or sound files.
